*** Ideas for passion project:

** A game such as Hangman or quiz or tic tac toe or card game with user interface?

** Build a REST API

** To-do app

** Expense manager 

This app allows users to log expenses and track them under default or custom categories. Users can use default categories or may add new custom categories. They can also view historical analysis of expenses and set goals for expenses limits or savings limits depending on projection of income or salary.
The backend of this app requires a database that allows the data to be stored, modified & retrieved.

** Notes app

This app allows users to add notes, enter photographs/videos of hand written notes, (extension - enable search feature to handwritten notes using AI/NN??), track changes, ability to use apple pencil?.
Development requires a big repository/cloud to store notes & other high storage itesm such as videos/graphics/images etc.

** Facial recognition app (ML/DNN??) - complicated??

** News site - web crawling & web scraping?
